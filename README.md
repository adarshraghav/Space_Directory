# space_directory
Designed a directory to list all space missions from 1967 to 2020. The directory was supported by a backend SQL database which would consist of mainly seven columns. These columns are Company name, location, detail, rocket status, and mission status. We have created an ER and relational diagram to visualise the database for our project, which can be seen in this report below. We plan to use mySQL workbench and mySQL server to build the tables using SQL language. We are using SQL because it is a very powerful language yet very easy to implement and execute.
